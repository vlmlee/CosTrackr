#Costrakr

This is a design project I had in my head for some time. The app is hosted [here](http://www.costrakr.com) and you can sign up without using an email.

It has all of the dynamic real time rendering you expect from react and I've included search, profile, and live commenting features. It was designed by me, but I am using various libraries like [react-skylight](https://github.com/marcio/react-skylight), [react-spin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spin), [react-dropzone](https://github.com/okonet/react-dropzone), [moment](http://momentjs.com/), etc.
